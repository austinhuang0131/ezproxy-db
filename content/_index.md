### What happened to ezproxy-db.appspot.com?

[I][me] decided to update and simplify the site.  We didn't need a specialized
app to manage a simple set of URLs.  Instead, the database is just a single
file, and this site generated statically from it.  Keeping everything in a
normal Git repository gets us a bunch of features for free, like tracking
changes to the database, and lets me more easily add co-maintainers.

The [previous version][appengine] is still running for now.  Requests to the
HTML index page are redirected here.  Requests for the [proxies.json][json]
file are proxied through, in order to support upgrading browser extensions to
use the new URL.  This will be supported at least through the end of 2022.

Feel free to [discuss this on the discussion board][board].
